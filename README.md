## Introduction

The YouTube Transcript Summarizer simplifies the process of extracting key information from YouTube videos by generating brief and coherent summaries of their transcripts. This tool is especially useful for users who need to quickly understand the content of lengthy videos without watching them in full.

## Proposed Ideas

1. **Automated Transcription Retrieval**: Fetching YouTube video transcripts using YouTube Data API.
2. **Summarization Algorithm**: Implementing state-of-the-art NLP models to summarize the extracted transcripts.
3. **User-Friendly Interface**: Creating an intuitive and responsive UI for users to input YouTube links and receive summaries.
4. **Scalability and Performance**: Ensuring the application can handle multiple requests efficiently.

## Major Steps

1. **Set Up Next.js Project**: Initialize the Next.js framework to build the web application.
2. **Integrate YouTube Data API**: Fetch transcripts from YouTube videos.
3. **Install and Configure Transformers.js**: Set up Transformers.js to process and summarize the transcripts.
4. **Develop Frontend Components**: Create input forms and display areas for transcripts and summaries.
5. **Implement Backend Logic**: Handle API requests, manage data processing, and return results to the frontend.
6. **Testing and Debugging**: Ensure the application works correctly and efficiently through rigorous testing.

## Techniques

### NLP Models and Transformers.js

- **Transformer Models**: Utilizing models like BERT, GPT, or T5 for summarization tasks.
- **Tokenization and Embeddings**: Converting text into tokens and embeddings suitable for processing by transformer models.
- **Summarization Pipeline**: Using pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for the specific task of summarizing YouTube transcripts.

### Frontend Development with Next.js

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Leveraging SSR for better performance and SEO.
- **API Routes**: Creating API endpoints within the Next.js application to handle transcript retrieval and summarization requests.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the web application is usable across various devices and screen sizes.

## Evaluations

1. **Accuracy of Summaries**: Evaluating the precision and coherence of generated summaries against human-generated summaries.
2. **Performance Metrics**: Measuring the application's response time, scalability, and ability to handle multiple simultaneous requests.
3. **User Feedback**: Gathering feedback from users to improve the interface and summarization quality.
4. **Error Handling**: Implementing robust error handling to manage issues such as unavailable transcripts or API rate limits.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adusumilli-amruta/youtube-transcript.git
   cd youtube-transcript-summarizer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables for YouTube Data API key and other configurations.
